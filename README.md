Kafka Http Metrics Reporter
==============================

This is a http metrics reporter for kafka using
Jetty with the metrics servlets (http://metrics.codahale.com/manual/servlets/kafka ) for exposing the metrics as JSON Objects.
Instead of retrieving metrics through JMX with JConsole it is now possible to retrieve the metrics with curl or some other http / rest client.
Code is tested with Kafka 0.8.0
